# OS-CA1-Socket-Programming
The purpose of this project is to get familiar with C language system calls and to learn the basics of socket programming.<br/>
What is a socket?<br/>
A socket is a mechanism for communication between two processes on one or more machines. In this two-way communication, the socket is like a terminal to which we send or receive information. In fact, the socket is a type of abstraction for the lower layers of the operating system that makes this connection possible.
